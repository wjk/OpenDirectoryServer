# Open Directory Server Application

This app sets up and manages the Open Directory service built into macOS. This is
the same service used by the macOS Server app on the Mac App Store. The Open
Directory Server app does more than its macOS Server equivalent, including:

* Configure fine-grained password policies for users and groups
* Enable SMB Windows file sharing access for directory users
* Not end-of-life’d abandonware!
* 100% free and open-source under [GNU General Public License](./COPYING)

**This app will now be developed in private, and sold commercially
when complete. Per the terms of the GNU GPL, this repository will
remain publicly available in a read-only state.**
