# Open Directory Server Application

This app sets up and manages the Open Directory service built into macOS. This is
the same service used by the macOS Server app on the Mac App Store. The Open
Directory Server app does more than its macOS Server equivalent, including:

* Add configuration profiles into the Open Directory records, so they are applied immediately upon login
* Configure fine-grained password policies for users and groups
* Not end-of-lifeâ€™d abandonware!
* 100% free and open-source under [GNU General Public License](./COPYING)
